#Starting the program
The program have a console based user interface. To start the program either double click on the script "StartBoatClubConsole.bat" or write in your command prompt "java -jar BoatClubConsole.jar". To be able to start the program you will need to have Java virtual machine installed.

#Instructions
When the program is started a menu of commands is displayed. 
  0: Create new member
  1: Compact member list
  2: Verbose member list
  3: Delete member
  4: Change member info
  5: View member
  6: Register boat
  7: Delete boat
  8: Change boat info
  9: Display menu
To start any of the functions simply write the number that corresponds to the wanted action. After a action is complete you will be directed to the command choosing phase again.
You can always cancel a method and go back to the command choosing phase by giving "b" instead of asked input.

If the user put in wrong input, such as, a string when an integer is expected or for example an id that dosent exists, the user will get a notification and be directed to the command choosing phase again. In other words, if any input is wrong in a action the user have to start over again, as we say in Sweden (Gör om, och gör rätt).
